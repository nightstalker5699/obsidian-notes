This is a **GitHub Actions workflow** designed to **automate the deployment** of your **frontend application** to **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

Let‚Äôs break it down step by step:

---

### **1. `name: Deploy Frontend`**

This is just a **name** for your GitHub Actions workflow, making it easy to identify. It will be displayed in GitHub Actions logs.

---

### **2. `on: push: branches: - main`**

This specifies that the workflow should **run automatically** whenever there is a push to the `main` branch. So, anytime code is pushed to `main`, this workflow will be triggered.

---

### **3. `jobs:`**

The `jobs` section defines the tasks that GitHub Actions will perform.

#### **a. `build:`**

This is the name of the job. It's where all the actions will be performed, such as building your Docker container, testing it, zipping files, and deploying to AWS.

- **`runs-on: ubuntu-latest`**: This tells GitHub Actions to run this job on a virtual machine with the latest Ubuntu operating system.
    

---

### **4. `steps:`**

This section contains the individual steps that are part of the `build` job. Each step runs sequentially.

#### **Step 1: `actions/checkout@v2`**

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

This step checks out your Git repository so that the following steps can access the files in your project.

#### **Step 2: `docker/login-action@v2` (Login to Docker Hub)**

```yaml
- name: Login to Docker Hub
  uses: docker/login-action@v2
  with:
    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
```

- This step logs into **Docker Hub** using your Docker Hub credentials stored in GitHub secrets (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`).
    
- This login is necessary to pull/push Docker images if needed in later steps.
    

#### **Step 3: `docker build` (Build Docker Container)**

```yaml
- run: docker build -t frontend -f dockerfile.dev .
```

- This step builds your **Docker container** using the `dockerfile.dev` located in your project. The `-t frontend` assigns the name `frontend` to the built Docker image.
    
- The `.` at the end means it will build from the current directory (where your `dockerfile.dev` is).
    

#### **Step 4: `docker run` (Run Tests)**

```yaml
- run: docker run -e CI=true frontend npm test
```

- This runs your Docker container and executes **`npm test`** inside the container. The `-e CI=true` environment variable tells npm to run in continuous integration mode, which ensures proper exit codes for build systems.
    
- If tests fail, this step will fail the entire workflow.
    

#### **Step 5: `zip -r front.zip . -x "*.git*" "node_modules/*"` (Create ZIP Package)**

```yaml
- name: create ZIP folder
  run: zip -r front.zip . -x "*.git*" "node_modules/*"
```

- After the tests pass, this step creates a **ZIP archive** of your project, excluding the `.git` folder and `node_modules` to avoid unnecessary files.
    
- This ZIP file (`front.zip`) will be the deployment package uploaded to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
    

#### **Step 6: `beanstalk-deploy@v22` (Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk)**

```yaml
- name: deploy to aws beanstalk
  uses: einaregilsson/beanstalk-deploy@v22
  with:
    region: us-east-1
    application_name: frontend
    environment_name: Frontend-env
    deployment_package: front.zip
    version_label: 3
    aws_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS }}
    aws_secret_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_SECRET }}
```

- This step uses the **`beanstalk-deploy` action** to deploy the **`front.zip`** file to **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.
    
    - **`region: us-east-1`**: The AWS region where the Beanstalk environment is located.
        
    - **`application_name: frontend`**: The name of your Elastic Beanstalk application.
        
    - **`environment_name: Frontend-env`**: The name of your Elastic Beanstalk environment where the app will be deployed.
        
    - **`deployment_package: front.zip`**: The ZIP file you created earlier in the workflow.
        
    - **`version_label: 3`**: The version label for this deployment. It can be changed each time (like using the build number or commit hash).
        
    - **`aws_access_key` & `aws_secret_key`**: These are **AWS credentials** stored in GitHub secrets to authenticate with AWS.

## üìù Summary

- **When the `main` branch is updated**, GitHub Actions runs:
    
    - **Checks out your code**
        
    - **Builds your Docker image**
        
    - **Runs tests inside the container**
        
    - **Zips the application** (excluding unnecessary files)
        
    - **Deploys the ZIP file to AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
        

---

### üîë Key Takeaways:

- This workflow automates the entire process: build, test, package, and deploy to Elastic Beanstalk whenever you push to the `main` branch.
    
- **AWS credentials** (access key and secret key) are stored as GitHub secrets to keep them secure.
