### Docker & Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Notes

#### Key Takeaways:
1. **Port Exposure in Docker**:  
   - By default, no ports inside a Docker container are exposed to the outside world.  
   - Use the `EXPOSE` instruction in the Dockerfile to specify which ports the container listens on.  
   - Example:  
     ```dockerfile
     FROM nginx
     EXPOSE 80
     ```  
   - Note: `EXPOSE` is primarily for documentation in most environments, but Elastic Beanstalk uses it to automatically map ports.

2. **Elastic Beanstalk Behavior**:  
   - Elastic Beanstalk scans the Dockerfile for the `EXPOSE` instruction and maps the specified port(s) for incoming traffic.  
   - Without `EXPOSE`, the deployed application will fail to load (health status may show "degraded").

3. **Workflow with GitHub & Travis CI**:  
   - **Feature Branch Workflow**:  
     1. Create a feature branch:  
        ```bash
        git checkout -b feature
        ```  
     2. Make changes, commit, and push to GitHub:  
        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "change app text"
        git push origin feature
        ```  
     3. Create a pull request (PR) on GitHub to merge into `master`.  
     4. Travis CI automatically runs tests on the PR.  
     5. After approval, merge the PR into `master`, triggering a deployment to Elastic Beanstalk.  

4. **Debugging Deployment Issues**:  
   - If the application fails to load after deployment, check:  
     - The Dockerfile includes `EXPOSE` for the correct port (e.g., `80` for HTTP).  
     - The Elastic Beanstalk environment health status.  
     - Travis CI logs for build/test errors.  

#### Example Dockerfile for Elastic Beanstalk:
```dockerfile
FROM nginx
EXPOSE 80
COPY /build /usr/share/nginx/html
```

#### Example Workflow Commands:
```bash
# Create and switch to a feature branch
git checkout -b feature

# After making changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Updated app text"
git push origin feature

# After PR is merged:
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```

#### Remember:
- `EXPOSE` is critical for Elastic Beanstalk deployments.  
- Always test changes in a feature branch before merging to `master`.  
- Monitor Travis CI and Elastic Beanstalk logs for deployment issues.
