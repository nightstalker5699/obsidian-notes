### **GitHub Actions Overview**  
**GitHub Actions** is a **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)** platform built into GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows directly from your GitHub repository.  

### **Key Features**  
âœ… **Automate Tasks** â€“ Run tests, build code, deploy apps, and more.  
âœ… **Event-Driven** â€“ Trigger workflows on GitHub events (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `release`).  
âœ… **Workflows as Code** â€“ Define workflows using YAML files (`.github/workflows/`).  
âœ… **Cross-Platform** â€“ Run jobs on Linux, Windows, macOS, or in containers.  
âœ… **Extensible** â€“ Use pre-built actions from the **GitHub Marketplace** or write custom scripts.

### **How GitHub Actions Works**  
1. **Workflows** â€“ Defined in `.yml` files inside `.github/workflows/`.  
2. **Events** â€“ Trigger workflows (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`).  
3. **Jobs** â€“ Groups of steps that run on a **runner** (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted).  
4. **Steps** â€“ Individual tasks (run commands, use actions).  
5. **Actions** â€“ Reusable units of code (e.g., `actions/checkout@v4`).

### **Example Workflow (Simple CI Pipeline)**  
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline  
on: [push]  # Runs on every push  

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Check out code  
      - name: Install dependencies  
        run: npm install  
      - name: Run tests  
        run: npm test  
```

### **Common Use Cases**  
ðŸ”¹ **Automated Testing** â€“ Run tests on every commit.  
ðŸ”¹ **Continuous Deployment (CD)** â€“ Deploy to AWS, Netlify, etc.  
ðŸ”¹ **Scheduled Tasks** â€“ Run scripts at specific times (e.g., backups).  
ðŸ”¹ **Code Linting & Formatting** â€“ Enforce code style automatically.  
ðŸ”¹ **Docker Builds** â€“ Build and push Docker images.

### **Why Use GitHub Actions?**  
âœ” **Tight GitHub Integration** â€“ No need for external CI tools.  
âœ” **Free for Public Repos** â€“ Generous free tier for private repos.  
âœ” **Large Ecosystem** â€“ Thousands of pre-built actions available.
