We are going to start using GitHub Actions and AWS Elastic Beanstalk for our deployment workflow. First, weâ€™ll set up a GitHub repository and add our application code, including the Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations. From there, any push to the `main` branch will trigger GitHub Actions to run automated tests and, if successful, deploy the application to AWS Beanstalk.
