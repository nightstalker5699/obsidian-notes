An **EC2 IAM Instance Profile** is a way to **attach IAM roles to EC2 instances**, allowing the instance to securely access AWS services **without needing to store access keys** directly on the instance.

## ✅ Creating an EC2 IAM Instance Profile for Elastic Beanstalk

Starting from 2024, AWS no longer auto-generates the EC2 instance profile for Elastic Beanstalk environments—you now need to create it manually. Here's how:

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Open the AWS Management Console

Go to [https://console.aws.amazon.com](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and sign in.

#### 2. Navigate to IAM

- In the search bar, type **IAM**
    
- Click the **IAM** service from the results.
    

#### 3. Go to Roles

- In the left sidebar, under **Access management**, click **Roles**.
    

#### 4. Click **Create role**

#### 5. Choose Role Type

- Under **Trusted entity type**, select **AWS service**
    
- Then choose **EC2** under **Use cases**
    
- Click **Next**
    

#### 6. Attach Policies

- In the search bar, type: `AWSElasticBeanstalk`
    
- Select the following policies:
    
    - `AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier`
        
    - `AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier`
        
    - `AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker`
        
- Click **Next**
    

#### 7. Name the Role

- Set the role name as:  
    `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role`
    

#### 8. Create the Role

- Click the **Create role** button to finish.
