Perfect — now you're covering the final steps to **make Elastic Beanstalk and Docker Compose work smoothly together**. Let’s go over what each of these parts **means** and **why they’re needed**:

## 🪣 **S3 Bucket Configuration**

### 🔍 What’s happening?

When you create an Elastic Beanstalk environment, AWS automatically creates an **S3 bucket** to store:

- App version files
    
- Logs
    
- Temporary deployment data
    

However, **Amazon Linux 2** platforms sometimes require **ACLs (Access Control Lists)** to be enabled for proper file permissions, especially for custom Docker setups.

### ✅ What you’re doing:

- You're enabling **ACLs** in the bucket settings so Elastic Beanstalk and related services can **read/write files without permission errors**.
    
- You're telling AWS to prefer the **object writer (usually Elastic Beanstalk)** as the owner of uploaded files.
    

> ⚠️ Why it matters: Without this, you may get **access denied** or **permission issues** during deployments or log uploads.

## 🐳 **Required Updates for Docker Compose**

### 🔍 What’s the issue?

Elastic Beanstalk (especially with newer Linux platforms) expects a `docker-compose.yml` file. But you’re probably using a dev setup that might not be production-ready or is named differently.

### ✅ What you’re doing:

1. **Renaming your development Compose file** from:
    
    ```
    docker-compose.yml ➝ docker-compose-dev.yml
    ```
    
2. **Running your containers** with the `-f` flag to specify the correct file:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml down
    ```
    

This keeps your **development environment** separate and clean, while allowing AWS to still work with the expected Compose file name if needed for future production use.

## 📦 TL;DR

- You **enabled ACLs** on the S3 bucket so AWS services can manage files inside it correctly.
    
- You **renamed your local Docker Compose file** and learned how to build and run it explicitly to avoid conflicts with AWS’s default behavior.

Would you like a script or template that does this setup for you automatically? Or maybe a diagram showing how these AWS components (S3, EC2, Beanstalk, Docker) are linked together?
