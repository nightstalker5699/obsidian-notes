**Using Docker Compose for Development:**

- Docker Compose simplifies long `docker run` commands, especially when dealing with port mappings and volumes for development.
- Even for a single container, Docker Compose is useful for managing development configurations.
- Instead of a long `docker run` command, use `docker-compose up`.

**Configuring `docker-compose.yml`:**

- **Version:** Specify the Compose file version (e.g., '3').
- **Services:** Define the containers (services) to be run (e.g., 'web').
- **Build:**
    - Initially, `build: .` assumes a `Dockerfile` in the current directory.
    - If using a non-standard Dockerfile name (e.g., `Dockerfile.dev`), use `build:` with `context` (directory containing files, e.g., '.') and `dockerfile` (specific file name, e.g., `Dockerfile.dev`).
- **Ports:** Map host ports to container ports (e.g., '3000:3000').
- **Volumes:**
    - Map host directories to container directories for source code syncing (e.g., `.:/app`).
    - Use a "bookmark" volume for `node_modules` (`/app/node_modules`) to prevent the host `node_modules` (or lack thereof) from overwriting the container's `node_modules` installed during the image build.

```docker-compose
version: "3"

  

services:

  react-app:

    build:

      context: .

      dockerfile: dockerfile.dev

    ports:

      - "3000:3000"

    volumes:

      - /app/node_modules

      - .:/app
```

**Volumes and the `COPY` Instruction:**

- Volumes map host files into the container, reflecting changes immediately.
- When using a volume that maps the entire source code (like `.:/app`), the `COPY . /app` instruction in the `Dockerfile` might seem redundant for development, as the volume effectively overwrites the copied content at runtime.
- However, it's often recommended to keep the `COPY` instruction:
    - It ensures the image _could_ run standalone without the volume mount.
    - It's necessary for production builds where volumes aren't typically used for source code.
    - It serves as a reference for what files the application needs.
    - The initial `COPY package.json` and `npm install` steps are still required before the main `COPY . /app` to build dependencies into the image layer.
