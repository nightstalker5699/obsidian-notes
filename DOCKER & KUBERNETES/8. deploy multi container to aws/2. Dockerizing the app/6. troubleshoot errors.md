Okay, here's an explanation based on the files you provided:

These files are transcripts detailing steps for setting up and troubleshooting a multi-container application using Docker Compose, Nginx, and React.

1. **Starting the Application (15. Starting Up Docker Compose.txt):**
    
    - This part focuses on the initial launch of the application using the `docker-compose up --build` command.
    - It anticipates potential startup failures the first time because services like the API or worker might try to connect to Redis or Postgres before they are fully ready.
    - It suggests that restarting Docker Compose (`Ctrl+C` then `docker-compose up` again) can often resolve these initial timing issues.
    - It also mentions that Nginx might crash initially but should restart automatically due to its configuration.
2. **Troubleshooting Initial Bugs (17. Troubleshooting Startup Bugs.txt):**
    
    - This section addresses errors encountered after the first startup.
    - The primary troubleshooting step recommended is to stop (`Ctrl+C`) and restart (`docker-compose up`) the containers.
    - It instructs how to access the running application via the Nginx proxy at `localhost:3050`.
    - It points out a likely error message in the browser's console related to a WebSocket connection failing. This happens because the React development server tries to establish a connection for live reloading, which Nginx isn't yet configured to handle.
    - It confirms the application is partially working by testing the Fibonacci calculation feature.
3. **Fixing WebSocket Connections (19. Opening Websocket Connections.txt):**
    
    - This part specifically tackles the WebSocket error.
    - It explains the React development server needs this connection to automatically reload the browser when code changes.
    - The solution involves modifying the Nginx configuration (`nginx/default.conf`) to properly proxy WebSocket requests for the specific path `/sockjs-node` used by the React development server.
    - This requires adding specific `proxy_pass` and `proxy_set_header` directives to the Nginx configuration file.
    - After changing the Nginx configuration, you need to stop Docker Compose (`Ctrl+C`), rebuild the Nginx image (`docker-compose up --build`), and restart the application.
    - The expected outcome is the disappearance of the WebSocket error in the console and a fully functional application, including correct routing and calculations.

In essence, these files guide you through launching a Dockerized application, handling common initial startup errors, and configuring Nginx to correctly proxy WebSocket connections needed for the React development environment.
