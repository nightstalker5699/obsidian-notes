# Docker Compose Configuration for Worker and Client Services

This file continues the Docker Compose configuration by adding services for the client (React application) and worker (background processing) components of the application.

## Client Service Configuration

1. **Build Configuration**:
   ```yaml
   build:
     dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
     context: ./client
   ```
   - Uses a development-specific Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.dev`)
   - Build context points to the `client` directory containing React source code

2. **Volume Mounts**:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - /app/node_modules
     - ./client:/app
   ```
   - Preserves the container's `node_modules` directory
   - Maps the local `client` directory to `/app` in the container for live code updates

## Worker Service Configuration

1. **Build Configuration**:
   ```yaml
   build:
     dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
     context: ./worker
   ```
   - Similar to client but points to the `worker` directory
   - Uses the same development Dockerfile pattern

2. **Volume Mounts**:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - /app/node_modules
     - ./worker:/app
   ```
   - Same volume strategy as client service
   - Ensures worker code changes are reflected immediately

## Key Points

1. **Development Focus**:
   - All services use `Dockerfile.dev` for development-specific configurations
   - Volume mounts enable hot-reloading without rebuilding images

2. **Consistent Structure**:
   - Both client and worker follow the same pattern as the server service
   - Each has its own directory with source code (`client`, `worker`)

3. **Current Limitations**:
   - No port mappings are configured yet (mentioned as missing)
   - NGINX proxy/router is not yet implemented (will be added later)

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Need to configure port mappings for external access
   - Will add NGINX service for routing requests between:
     - Browser ↔ React server
     - Browser ↔ Express server

This configuration completes the core services needed for the application (server, client, worker, Postgres, Redis), with the remaining work focused on networking and routing configuration through NGINX.
