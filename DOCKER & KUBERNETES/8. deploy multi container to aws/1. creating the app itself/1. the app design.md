Here’s a concise summary of the key information from the transcripts:

### **Multi-Container Fibonacci Application Overview**  

#### **Application Purpose**  
- A deliberately overcomplicated Fibonacci calculator to demonstrate multi-container deployments.  
- Users submit an index (e.g., `7`), and the app calculates the Fibonacci value (e.g., `21`).  

#### **Components**  
1. **Frontend (React)**  
   - Displays a form for submitting indices and shows results.  
   - Served via **Nginx**, which routes:  
     - Frontend requests → React server.  
     - API requests → Express server.  

2. **Backend (Express API)**  
   - Receives submitted indices from React.  
   - Stores indices permanently in **Postgres**.  
   - Also pushes indices to **Redis** (to trigger the worker).  

3. **Worker (Node.js Process)**  
   - Monitors Redis for new indices.  
   - Calculates Fibonacci values and stores results back in Redis.  

4. **Databases**  
   - **Postgres**: Permanent storage for "indices seen."  
   - **Redis**: Temporary storage for indices and calculated values.  

#### **Why This Design?**  
- Overcomplicated to teach multi-container workflows (React, Express, Worker, Redis, Postgres).  
- Focuses on Docker/deployment, not application logic (e.g., no authentication).  

#### **Key Flow**  
1. User submits index → React → Express API.  
2. Express saves index to Postgres + Redis.  
3. Worker detects new index in Redis → calculates Fibonacci → saves result to Redis.  
4. React fetches results from Redis → displays them.  

#### **Note**  
- In production, some components (e.g., Nginx routing) may differ.  
- Real-world Fibonacci apps wouldn’t need this complexity—this is purely for learning Docker.
