Here’s a step-by-step guide for creating IAM keys for deployment (formatted for clarity and ease of use):

---

### **Creating IAM Access Keys for Deployment**

You can either use the **existing IAM User** from your single container app setup, or follow these steps to **create a new IAM user** specifically for this deployment.

---

#### **1. Open IAM Service**

- Go to the **AWS Management Console**
    
- Use the search bar to find and select **IAM (Security, Identity, & Compliance)**
    

---

#### **2. Create a New IAM User**

- Click **Users** in the sidebar
    
- Click **Add User**
    

---

#### **3. Configure User Details**

- In the **User name** field, enter a name (e.g., `docker-multi-travis-ci`)
    
- Click **Next**
    

---

#### **4. Set Permissions**

- Select **Attach policies directly**
    
- In the search bar, type **beanstalk**
    
- Check the box next to **AdministratorAccess-AWSElasticBeanstalk**
    
- Click **Next**
    

---

#### **5. Create User**

- Click **Create user**
    

---

#### **6. Generate Access Keys**

- From the list of users, click the newly created user
    
- Go to the **Security Credentials** tab
    
- Scroll to the **Access Keys** section
    
- Click **Create access key**
    

---

#### **7. Configure Access Key**

- Select **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
    
- Scroll down and tick the checkbox: **I understand the recommendation...**
    
- Click **Next**
    

---

#### **8. Save Your Keys**

- **Copy and/or download** the:
    
    - **Access Key ID**
        
    - **Secret Access Key**
        

You’ll need these keys for **Travis CI Variable Setup** (or any other CI/CD integration).
