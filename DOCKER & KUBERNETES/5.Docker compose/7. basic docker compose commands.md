Okay, I've added the information from the two new files to the consolidated notes:

### Consolidated Docker Compose Notes

**1. Introduction and Basic Usage (from "7. Docker Compose Commands.txt")**

- **Purpose:** Docker Compose simplifies running and managing multi-container Docker applications. It makes it easier than running individual `docker run` commands for each service.
- **Networking:** Docker Compose automatically sets up a network connecting the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. When started, it creates a default network (e.g., "visits_default").
- **Starting Services:**
    - Use `docker-compose up` to create and start all services based on the `docker-compose.yml` in the current directory.
    - Docker Compose looks for the `docker-compose.yml` file automatically.
- **Rebuilding Images:**
    - If you make changes to your application code or Dockerfile, use `docker-compose up --build`. This tells Compose to rebuild the necessary images before starting the containers.
- **Inter-Service Communication:**
    - Containers within the same Compose network can communicate using the service names defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file as hostnames.
    - For example, a web app service can connect to a database service named `redis-server` by using `redis-server` as the hostname in its connection configuration. Docker handles the name resolution.

**2. Stopping Containers (from "8. Stopping Docker Compose Containers.txt")**

- **Running in Background (Detached Mode):**
    - To start containers in the background, similar to `docker run -d`, use `docker-compose up -d`. This frees up your terminal.
- **Stopping Services:**
    - Instead of stopping each container individually (`docker stop <id>`), use `docker-compose down`.
    - `docker-compose down` stops and removes the containers, networks, and potentially volumes created by `docker-compose up`. It's the direct opposite of `up`.
- **Verification:**
    - Use `docker ps` to view running containers after `docker-compose up -d`.
    - Run `docker ps` again after `docker-compose down` to confirm the containers have been stopped and removed.

**3. Container Maintenance - Handling Crashes (from "9. Container Maintenance with Compose.txt")**

- **Problem:** Software running inside containers can crash or hang due to errors.
- **Goal:** Implement strategies to automatically restart containers that fail.
- **Demonstrating a Crash:**
    - The transcript describes intentionally modifying application code (`index.js`) to cause a crash (using `process.exit(0)`) when a specific route is accessed.
    - After rebuilding (`docker-compose up --build`) and accessing the route, the specific container crashes and stops.
    - Running `docker ps` confirms the crashed container is no longer running, while other containers in the Compose setup (like Redis) might still be active.

**4. Automatic Container Restarts (from "10. Automatic Container Restarts.txt")**

- **Restart Policies:** You can specify a `restart` policy for each service in your `docker-compose.yml` file to control whether/how Docker Compose restarts a container if it stops.
- **Exit Codes:**
    - An exit code of `0` (e.g., `process.exit(0)`) indicates the process stopped intentionally and without errors.
    - Any non-zero exit code indicates the process stopped due to an error or failure.
- **Available Policies:**
    - `"no"` (Default): Never restart the container, regardless of the exit code. Must be enclosed in quotes in the YAML file (e.g., `restart: "no"`) because `no` is interpreted as boolean `false` otherwise.
    - `always`: Always restart the container, regardless of the exit code. Useful for essential services like web servers. When a container restarts with this policy, it reuses the existing container instance but attaches to its logs, which might show previous output.
    - `on-failure`: Only restart the container if it exits with a non-zero exit code (indicating a failure). Useful for worker processes that are meant to finish a task and exit successfully.
    - `unless-stopped`: Always restart the container unless it was explicitly stopped by the user (e.g., using `docker stop`).
- **Applying Policies:** Add the `restart` key under the specific service definition in the `docker-compose.yml` file (e.g., `restart: always` or `restart: on-failure`).

**5. Checking Container Status (from "11. Container Status with Docker Compose.txt")**

- **Command:** Use `docker-compose ps` to view the status of containers managed by Docker Compose for the current project.
- **Context:** This command must be run from the same directory containing the relevant `docker-compose.yml` file. Docker Compose uses this file to identify which containers belong to the project.
- **Comparison:** It's similar to `docker ps` but specifically targets the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file in the current directory. If run from a different directory, it won't know which containers to report on.
