This part of the text describes the architecture and planning for a Docker-based web application that tracks the number of times a webpage has been visited. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

### **Application Overview**
1. **Purpose**:  
   - The application displays the number of times a webpage has been visited (e.g., "Number of visits: 10").
   - It consists of two main components:  
     - A **web server** (Node.js) to handle HTTP requests and serve HTML.  
     - A **Redis server** to store and manage the visit count.

2. **Why Redis?**  
   - Redis is an in-memory data store, acting like a lightweight database.  
   - While the visit count could be stored directly in the Node.js application, using Redis makes the application more scalable and separates concerns.

### **Architecture Choices**
1. **Initial Idea (Flawed Approach)**:  
   - One Docker container running both Node.js and Redis.  
   - **Problem**: If the app scales (e.g., multiple containers for load balancing), each container would have its own Redis instance, leading to inconsistent visit counts (e.g., one container shows 99 visits, another shows 3).

2. **Correct Approach**:  
   - **Separate Containers**:  
     - One container for the Node.js web server.  
     - Another container for the Redis server (single instance).  
   - **Scalability**:  
     - Multiple Node.js containers can be created to handle traffic, all connecting to the same Redis instance for a consistent visit count.  

---

### **Implementation Plan**
- **First Iteration**:  
  - Focus on setting up two containers:  
    1. **Node.js App**: Handles HTTP requests and displays the visit count.  
    2. **Redis Server**: Stores the visit count centrally.  
  - No scaling yet; just a basic working setup.  

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Redis is decoupled from the web server for better scalability.  
- **Scalability**: Multiple web servers can share a single Redis instance to maintain data consistency.  
- **Docker's Role**: Enables isolated, modular containers for each component (Node.js and Redis).  

This setup is a classic example of using Docker for microservices architecture, where each service (web server, database) runs in its own container for flexibility and scalability.
