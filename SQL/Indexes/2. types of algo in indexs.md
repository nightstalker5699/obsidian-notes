## Types of Index Algorithms

1. **B-tree Algorithm** (Default)
    
    - Best for comparison operators: >, <, BETWEEN, IN, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
    - Default algorithm when none specified
    - Good performance for most query types
2. **Hash Algorithm**
    
    - Optimized ONLY for equality checks (=)
    - Dramatically faster than B-tree for simple equality comparisons
    - Example showed performance improvement from ~1 second to 0.028 milliseconds
3. **GIN** (Generalized Inverted Index)
    
    - Best used when multiple values are stored in a single field
    - Ideal for array data types in PostgreSQL
4. **GiST** (Generalized Search Tree)
    
    - Useful for indexing geometric data
    - Great for full-text search operations
    - Recommended for searching text fields like reviews

## Key Takeaways

- The choice of algorithm can significantly impact query performance
- Index selection may influence how you structure your queries
- Algorithm choice should be made carefully, with research and team discussion
- Testing with EXPLAIN ANALYZE helps compare performance differences
- Creating the right indexes with appropriate algorithms can "supercharge" queries

## Creating Indexes with Specific Algorithms

Syntax:

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name USING algorithm_name (column_name);
```

Example:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_country_code ON city USING hash (country_code);
```

Remember to evaluate query patterns and data types when choosing an appropriate index algorithm.
