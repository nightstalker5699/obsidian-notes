DDL, DQL, DML, and DCL are the four main categories of SQL commands used for different operations in database management. Here's a breakdown:

---

### 1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**
- **Purpose**: Defines and manages the structure of the database.
- **Common Commands**:
  - `CREATE`: Creates database objects (e.g., tables, indexes).
  - `ALTER`: Modifies the structure of existing objects.
  - `DROP`: Deletes objects from the database.
  - `TRUNCATE`: Removes all data from a table but keeps its structure.
  - `RENAME`: Renames database objects.

---

### 2. **DQL (Data Query Language)**
- **Purpose**: Retrieves data from the database.
- **Common Commands**:
  - `SELECT`: Fetches data from one or more tables.

---

### 3. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**
- **Purpose**: Manipulates data stored in the database.
- **Common Commands**:
  - `INSERT`: Adds new data into a table.
  - `UPDATE`: Modifies existing data in a table.
  - `DELETE`: Removes data from a table.
  - `MERGE`: Combines insert and update operations (upsert).

---

### 4. **DCL (Data Control Language)**
- **Purpose**: Controls access to the database.
- **Common Commands**:
  - `GRANT`: Gives users access privileges.
  - `REVOKE`: Removes access privileges from users.

---

### Summary
- **DDL**: Manages database structure.
- **DQL**: Queries and retrieves data.
- **DML**: Manipulates data (insert, update, delete).
- **DCL**: Controls user access and permissions.

These commands work together to manage and interact with databases effectively.
