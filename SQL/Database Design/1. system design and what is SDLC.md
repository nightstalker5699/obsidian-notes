# System Design and the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

## Understanding SDLC

The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a structured process for building software systems that consists of several phases to ensure robust system design and development. The core phases are:

1. **System Planning and Selection** (Requirements Analysis)
2. **System Analysis**
3. **System Design**
4. **System Implementation and Operation**

These phases are iterative and cyclical - software is never truly "finished" as systems continually evolve.

## SDLC Phases Explained with Examples

### 1. System Planning and Selection (Requirements Analysis)

**Purpose:** Define what needs to be built and why.

**Activities:**
- Gathering business requirements
- Defining scope (SCOP)
- Identifying key features
- Determining feasibility

**Example:** Building an e-commerce platform
- Requirements might include: user accounts, product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing
- Scope might exclude: advanced recommendation engine (for initial version)

```
[Business Stakeholders] --> [Define Requirements] --> [Requirements Document]
```

### 2. System Analysis

**Purpose:** Analyze how to build what was planned.

**Activities:**
- Determining technical requirements
- Resource allocation
- Timeline estimation
- Risk assessment

**Example:** E-commerce platform analysis
- Need databases for products, users, orders
- Requires web application and possibly mobile apps
- Need payment gateway integration
- Estimated team: 5 developers, 3 months timeline

```
[Requirements] --> [Technical Analysis] --> [Architecture Decisions]
```

### 3. System Design

**Purpose:** Create detailed technical specifications.

**Activities:**
- Creating architecture diagrams
- Database schema design
- API specifications
- Component design

**Example:** E-commerce database design
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing tables for Users, Products, Orders
- API endpoints for product search, cart operations
- Microservices architecture diagram

```
Sample Database ERD:

+-------------+       +-------------+       +-------------+
|   Users     |       |  Products   |       |   Orders    |
+-------------+       +-------------+       +-------------+
| user_id (PK)|       | product_id  |       | order_id    |
| username    |       | name        |       | user_id (FK)|
| email       |       | price       |       | order_date  |
| password    |       | description |       | status      |
+-------------+       | category    |       +-------------+
                      +-------------+             |
                                                 |
                          +----------------------+
                          |
                      +-------------+
                      | Order_Items |
                      +-------------+
                      | order_id (FK)|
                      | product_id  |
                      | quantity    |
                      | price       |
                      +-------------+
```

### 4. System Implementation and Operation

**Purpose:** Build and maintain the system.

**Activities:**
- Coding
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance
- Monitoring

**Example:** E-commerce implementation
- Developing frontend and backend components
- Writing SQL queries for database operations
- Deploying to production
- Monitoring for performance issues

```
[Development] --> [Testing] --> [Deployment] --> [Monitoring]
       ↑____________|________________|_____________|
```

## SDLC Methodologies

Different methodologies implement these phases in different ways:

### 1. Waterfall Model

- Sequential, rigid phases
- Good for highly regulated industries (healthcare, aviation)
- Example: Patient monitoring system where each phase must be thoroughly completed before moving to the next

```
Requirements → Analysis → Design → Implementation → Testing → Maintenance
```

### 2. Agile Model

- Iterative, flexible approach
- Phases overlap and repeat in sprints
- Example: Social media app where features are continuously added

```
Sprint 1: [Plan] → [Design] → [Implement] → [Test] → [Review]
Sprint 2: [Plan] → [Design] → [Implement] → [Test] → [Review]
...
```

### 3. V-Model

- Verification and validation at each stage
- Common in hardware/embedded systems
- Example: Automotive control systems

```
Requirements → High-level Design → Detailed Design → Implementation
   ↑               ↑                   ↑               ↑
Testing Plan ← Integration Test ← Component Test ← Unit Testing
```

## Key SDLC Principles

1. **Low Coupling, High Cohesion**
   - Components should be independent (low coupling)
   - Components should have single, well-defined purposes (high cohesion)
   - Example: In microservices architecture, each service handles one business capability

2. **Testing Throughout**
   - Not just a separate phase
   - Example: In Agile, continuous testing with each sprint

3. **Communication and Documentation**
   - Essential at every phase
   - Example: API documentation, architecture decision records

## Database Design in SDLC

Database design primarily occurs in Phase 3 (System Design) but connects to all phases:

1. **Phase 1:** Determine what data needs to be stored
2. **Phase 2:** Analyze data relationships and volumes
3. **Phase 3:** Create ER diagrams and schema
4. **Phase 4:** Implement, optimize, and maintain database

```
SDLC with Database Focus:

[Business Requirements] → [Data Requirements] → [ER Design] → [SQL Implementation]
```

Understanding SDLC helps database professionals see how their work fits into the larger system context and collaborate more effectively with other teams.
